Get karma points for doing chores around the house.


#Get sh*t done
This app is a fun way to get stuff done around the house. 
Add your roommates, then add stuff for them to do around the house. 
They will receive a push notification alerting them of a new task to complete. 
Once they complete this chore, they will receive the number of karma points that you had previously defined.
If they fail to complete in a timely manner, their karma count will be decremented.

#Reaching Nirvana
As your karma grows, you will unlock a new character for different steps
on your quest to enlightnment. Start as a hippy, become the Karma Koala this world needs.

#Security Policy
We respect your privacy. We only gather crash logs to make the app better.
As soon as a task is completed, it is deleted from the servers.
We will never personally sell, disclose or tamper with any of your information,
but be aware that the data is hosted on Parse™ servers, a Facebook™ company. 
All communications with the server are secured using "military grade encryption". 
Just kidding, we don't advertise bullshit. We do use https and ssl by default though.
